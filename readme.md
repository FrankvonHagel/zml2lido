# zml2lido - Xslt that rewrites ZML to Lido

I use "zml" as the name of the xml format that comes out of MpRia's API.
* See: http://docs.zetcom.com/ws/ 
* For LIDO see http://www.lido-schema.org
* Use Saxon to run xslt newer than version 1: //http://saxon.sourceforge.net/

This mapping is in an early state and NOT yet fully implemented.
